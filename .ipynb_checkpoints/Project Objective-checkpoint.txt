Objective: I have some shares which I have kept for a longer duration. Now I dont want any weekly updates but I want to see updates on monthly basis.
The information can be-
- How are the shares trending for my portfolio
- Any news related to my portfolio, so that I can take calls accordingly
Ideally I want to see this information on my mail box, so that I can refer them at my convinience.

Project Structure

- Analysis of protfolio that I have
    - Data for the stock that I hold in my portfolio
        - A location through which I can collect the stock data on a FOC basis
    - Analysis done on the data
        - The analysis should ideally be a creative visualization, so that reading effect could be minimized
    - Some news articles (Url's) which could be scrapped from the internet

- The entire information to be shared onmy mail
    - Mail to be triggered every 1 st of the Month
